Project Overview: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

By understanding customer segments, businesses can optimize marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and deliver tailored experiences.

Skills Demonstrated
Python Programming
Data Manipulation with pandas
Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Clustering Algorithms: K-Means
Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset, which contains the following features:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Customer's gender
Age: Customer's age
Annual Income (k$): Customer's yearly income in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned based on customer spending patterns
Steps Involved
Data Exploration and Visualization

Analyzed data distributions and patterns using statistical summaries and plots.
Visualized relationships between features like Age, Income, and Spending Score.
Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values and cleaned the dataset.
Scaled numerical features for better clustering performance.
K-Means Clustering

Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Applied K-Means to group customers into distinct segments.
Insights and Recommendations

Interpreted the clusters to uncover customer behavior.
Suggested actionable strategies for marketing and service improvements.
Results and Insights
The analysis successfully identified distinct customer segments, allowing businesses to:

Personalize marketing campaigns.
Enhance customer retention by understanding their preferences.
Allocate resources effectively for customer satisfaction.
