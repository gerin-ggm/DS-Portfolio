# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

## Objective
The project aims to analyze a customer dataset and identify distinct groups based on purchasing behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Skills Involved
- Python
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- K-Means

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Mall Customer Segmentation Data**, containing:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Steps Involved
1. Data Exploration and Visualization
2. Data Preprocessing
3. K-Means Clustering
4. Insights and Recommendations

## Results
The analysis identifies customer segments, allowing businesses to:
- Develop targeted marketing strategies.
- Enhance customer satisfaction.

- There are other programs using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest and K-Means

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gerin-ggm/DS-Portfolio.git
