- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- K-Means

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Mall Customer Segmentation Data**, containing:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Steps Involved
1. Data Exploration and Visualization
2. Data Preprocessing
3. K-Means Clustering
4. Insights and Recommendations

## Results

  Customer Churn Prediction

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a crucial task in business analytics that helps organizations identify customers who are likely to stop using their services. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict churn based on customer behavior and demographic data.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information, including:

Customer ID

Demographics (Age, Gender, Location, etc.)

Service Usage (Call Duration, Internet Usage, etc.)

Account Information (Subscription Plan, Billing Amount, Tenure, etc.)

Churn Label (0: Retained, 1: Churned)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Models: LinearRegression,Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to:

Check for missing values

Visualize data distributions

Identify correlations between features

Analyze churn trends

🤖 Model Training

Data was preprocessed (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical values).

Various ML models were trained and evaluated.

The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📈 Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.79%.

Feature importance analysis revealed that Tenure and monthly charges were the most influential factors in churn prediction.
